			<h2>Skateboarding</h2>
			</a></p>	
				<p>
					Skateboarding was probably born 
					sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s,
					when surfers in California wanted something to 
					do when the waves were flat. This was called 
					"sidewalk surfing" - a new wave of surfing on 
					the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became 
					highly popular. No one knows who made the 
					first board; it seems that several people came 
					up with similar ideas at around the same time. 
					The first manufactured skateboards were ordered 
					by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant 
					to be used by surfers in their downtime.

			<h2>Annabelle</h2>
			</a></p>	
				<p>
					Annabelle is a 2014 American supernatural horror 
					film directed by John R. Leonetti, written by Gary 
					Dauberman and produced by Peter Safran and James Wan. 
					It is a prequel to 2013's The Conjuring and the 
					second installment in The Conjuring series. The 
					film was inspired by a story of a doll named 
					Annabelle told by Ed and Lorraine Warren.
					The film stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, and 
					Alfre Woodard.
