		<h2><font color="blue" face="sans-serif">Playing videogames</font></h2>
		<p><font color="purple" face="verdana" size=4>I really like playing videogames, I play mostly on PC, however I do own consoles which I like to use every now and then. 
			My favourite game is L.A. Noire, developed by Rockstar Games. Although, my most played game is Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I've already put into it 485 hours.

		<h2><font color="blue" face="sans-serif">Listening to music</font></h2>
		<p><font color="purple" face="verdana" size=4>I love listening to music, it doesn't have to be any artist or genre in particular for me to enjoy it.
			Though, I am a big Beatles fan, they are my favourite band. Actually, I do listen to a lot of rock bands, like Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana. Going to live concerts is the best way to listen to music, you truly feel a connection with the artist.
