				Skateboarding was probably born 
				sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s,
				when surfers in California wanted something to 
				do when the waves were flat. This was called 
				"sidewalk surfing" - a new wave of surfing on 
				the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became 
				highly popular. No one knows who made the 
				first board; it seems that several people came 
				up with similar ideas at around the same time. 
				The first manufactured skateboards were ordered 
				by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant 
				to be used by surfers in their downtime.

				Annabelle is a 2014 American supernatural horror 
				film directed by John R. Leonetti, written by Gary 
				Dauberman and produced by Peter Safran and James Wan. 
				It is a prequel to 2013's The Conjuring and the 
				second installment in The Conjuring series. The 
				film was inspired by a story of a doll named 
				Annabelle told by Ed and Lorraine Warren.
				The film stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, and 
				Alfre Woodard.
