	  Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between
	  two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. 
	  The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, 
	  called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the 
	  batting team tries to hit with a bat. </p>

		<p>
	  Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually 
	  against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams 
	  of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis 
	  racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber 
	  ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the 
	  opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball
	  in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid 
	  return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not
	  gain a point, while the opposite player will.

		<p>
	  It's a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing 
	  protective gloves, throw punches at each other for a 
	  predetermined set of time in a boxing ring.  Boxing is 
	  supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute 
	  intervals called rounds. The result is decided when an opponent 
	  is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified 
	  for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel, or is 
	  pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards 
	  at the end of the contest.

	  Basketball is a limited-contact sport played on a 
	  rectangular court. While most often played as a team 
	  sport with five players on each side, three-on-three, 
	  two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. 
	  The objective is to shoot a basketball (approximately 9.4 
	  inches (24 cm) in diameter) through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) 
	  in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high that is mounted to a 
	  backboard at each end of the court.
